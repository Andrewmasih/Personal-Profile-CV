# My Persoanl profile web project

## Welcome to my personal profile webpage project!

This website was built as a part of my learning material for CodeInsitute's
Software Development programme.

## You can check out the website from this link here! 

the site is published at https://andrewmasih.github.io/Milestone-WebProject/

# Project description

this site was developed to get familiar with coding in HTML and CSS, also 
linking to other resources like Google fonts, Bootstrap and Font awesome.
Also, this project gave me an opportunity to run through all the process that I have learned from the development programme.
from using a new IDE with Gitpod, then linking it to GitHub.

# User Experience
Expected users of the website include potential employers, potential clients, software developers and students of all kinds. 
They come to the website with questions in need of answering.

### User Stories
1. for anyone who wants to know my professional profile, including my work experience, tech skills, soft skills, projects and references. 
2. A future Employer that is looking at my skills, experience and projects.  
3. A client that could be interested in collaboration
4. A software developer could be interested in looking at the site.
5. Friends or family that are interested in what I do and how. 


## Mockups
The web app is a single page with different displays given for different functions:

# wireframing 

Figma software was used for illustrating the final design and structure.

## Existing Features

### Design and Layout

The design has been developed for Mobile First approach. 

The main focus on the design and layout was to be clear and simple, as information sometimes on a cv can be clustered, and overwhelming for the reader,
sometimes the reader can be put off with the CV because of the amount of information been displayed with space, the aim was to provide information relative to my CV. 
From top to bottom, left to right, the information on the site is similar to how a tradition CV is a layout.

I had designed the layout in a way that doesn't overload the reader/user with too much information as sometimes a traditional cv can.
in fact, the results are that the page provides my professional info to the user with ease to read, the user is made to feel at ease/comfortable by the use of colors, layout, spacing, white space, text style and images. 

The information on the page is layout systematically, so the user is not bombarded with information that the user can skip over.
The design encourages the user to take time to absorb the info comfortably, the colours are kept muted and not so bright is a contrast to the white background which reflects the type/text in a clear fashion. 

A menu is provided on the side of the screen for small screens, and on the top of the page for large screens so the user can access the information they require 
immediately. 
The menu has buttons that bring up the chosen section they require to view.

## Features left to implement

### Scroll Bar:
For large chunks on the information, I have provided a scroll system for the user to read through the text at ease, without compromising other sections on the page.

### External Links or Anchors:
The portfolio section I implemented the use of external links to corresponding sites, here I have used icons that will take the user to external sites that are relative to my professional profile. 

### Form section:
I have used a Form section for users to write to me or email me directly. the boxes in the form section are animated and extend out when the user clicks or type within the boxes.

### Nav bar:
A menu sits in the navbar, its located on the side of the screen for small screens, and on the top of the page for large screens. The user can access the information they require immediately. 
The menu has buttons that bring up the chosen section they require to view.

# Testing 

The site was tested through a number of means. 

to begin with, I had looked into the visual side of testing, to make sure images and layout of the site was satisfactory in working order and easily read.

I also tested the buttons, links, navigation around the site and the contact page was in working order in different devices, from different smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, 

- dev tools, responsive and specific to Moto 4, Samsung S5, Samsung 7, 8, Pixel 2, 
Pixel 2XL, iPhone 5SE, iPhone5, 6, 7, 8, 8plus, 10, iPad, iPad pro.

- Samsung7 and 8 handsets belong to me and tested horizontally and vertically viewpoints.
- tested my site on "I am responsive design" website, this checks how responsive the site is based on different devices, screen sizes. 
    Viewports
    -Desktop
    1600x992px scaled down to scale(0.3181)
    -Laptop
    1280x802px scaled down to scale(0.277)
    -Tablet
    768x1024px scaled down to scale(0.219)
    -Mobile
    320x480px scaled down to scale(0.219)

- the site has also been tested on HP Pavilion Laptop, HP Pavilion desktop, Samsung galaxy tablet, 
- Friends and family have used the site without instruction, testing the navigation and links. 


### Contact form:

1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.



# Deployment

## The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages] ("https://github.com/Andrewmasih/Milestone-WebProject")

### the site is published at https://andrewmasih.github.io/Milestone-WebProject/

### The process involved:
- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo).
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files
- On GitHub, repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)
- Provided link will be your projects home (index) page.
 
### To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the [repository][GitHub] ("https://github.com/Andrewmasih/Milestone-WebProject")
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open your chosen IDE (gitpod, Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
    - Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser
- Visit the link provided
- Your website with any made changes will appear
- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged into the master when complete.

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.

During development, the site is written in VS Code. It is run using Live Server plugin for VS Code.
